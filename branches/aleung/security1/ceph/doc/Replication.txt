Primary copy replication.

Inodes:

- The primary's list of replicas (cached_by) is inclusive at all times.
- The primary's list never includes the local node.
- The primary's list of replicas will only include non-replicas when the relevant CacheExpire notifications are in-flight.

- Replicas can be created in two ways:
  - via a Discover + DiscoverReply
  - via an export and import.  (The old auth keeps a copy, and adds itself to the replica list as it exports.)


Directories (and their dentries):

- The primary has an open_by list that is inclusive at all times.
- ..Never includes local node
- No per-dentry replica lists.  All dentry lock operations (for unlink, etc.) are sent to all nodes in open_by list.
