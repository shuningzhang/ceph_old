/*
 * These are the various messages that can be sent between the master
 * and slave. The slave sends one reply to each message from the master.

 * PING/PINGREPLY: just what it sounds like.

 * STARTTASK: starts a task from the given library. The slave attempts
 * to perform the task, and replies with FINISHEDTASK or TASKFAILED.
 *
 * RETRIEVELOCALFILE: requests a file that the slave has stored
 * locally. Slave replies with SENDLOCALFILE and the file, or with
 * LOCALFILENOTFOUND.
 * 
 * (deprecated) SHIPCODE: sends a shared library to the slave, containing a
 * function that is to be executed later by the STARTTASK
 * command. Slave replies with CODESAVED or SHIPFAILED.
 *
 * SHIPCODE is replaced by transport using Ceph.
